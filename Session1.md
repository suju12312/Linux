# Linux v9 training zero to  hero
### Divide into three levels
 Level 1 ---> Enablement / Basic Linux
 Level 2 ---> Linux Advance (RHCSA)
 Level 3 ---> Create own Linux O.S (if selected)

# session 1
 
## Topic Covered


## Key Points
- Linux gives us a right foundation
- Switching to security,cisco,Devops will become easy
- World 500 supercomputers fastest all run on Linux
- 96.3% of top one millionweb servers are running Linux
- 90% company used red hat
- commercial bank , technology companies , communication servce providers sed red hart linux 



### why linux?
- Supercomputers build on the top of Linux Operating system
- Facebook (All os in this run on linux)
- Google (Data centre is running on Linux)
- LINUX POWERS 85% OF SMARTPHONES
- Today there are over 600 active linux distros(means different distribution of linux)

## Technology/IT
    |
    |__ __ __ __>>> Operating System

- means that if want to do with digital world then we need  physical hardware like ram / cpu / hard disk etc
- cpu does not know our language means human being that why we kapt o.s on above physical hardware.
-Humans connect to os  and then it connect to physical hardware.
- operating system is the software/program created by multiplecompanies.

      ## o.s-----> M.S (Windows)
      ##    -----> Apple (MAC)
      ##    ------>  Community (code) -----> O.S ---> eg .Linux (Open source)
## which is a good os?
- Everyone is good depend where we have to se it 
- Desktop requirement (Mac or Windows) Multimedia.
- Technical requirement (Linux)
- company ---> create app ----> Linux 

                 use                       is
 -  H.B (USER) --------->   O.S (USECASE) ---> (USE IT BECAUSE TO RUN ONLY A PROGRAM )


## what is linux?
- Linux is an operaing system which belong to open community (open source) means there is no dedicated company for this have no authority.
- It is dangerous because example like netflix -->WEBAPP --> RUN ON LINUX o.s --> o.s it is software ---> IF CODE FAILED THEN NO ONE HAVE RESPONSIBLE.
- Lot of company come to market they go to community and get code then test by own company if any bug there they remove it and make ready for corporate use
- The google take o.s linux from all ths company (e.g oracle linux , amazon linux ) 
- top company name is red hat (rhel 9.2)
- without os we cannot run any program
- we interact o.s not directly but interact via app means program.
- H.B ---> APP (PROGRAM) -----> O.S (LINUX -> REDHAT)
-

## Installation of rhel 9.2
- download from red hat website (rhel 9.2) (OS IMAGE)
- physical hardware ---> o.s windows -----> virtualization program (help to install one os on the top of window or many more (vm warwe / virtual box)
- install software vitual box 
-  open virtual box select new then name it as guest os or vm 
- need os image (rhell 9) then select that FORMAT NAME IS IOS.
- if version came as linux 64 bit then ok but if came 32 bit then shut down laptop and then press esacpe key open bios settings and then go to advanced or bios setting select virtualization disable do enable it.
- For O.s we havr to give cpu and ram then give 2 cpu  and base memeory as 8192mb if 16gb ram.
- hard disk as 20.00 gb (store data permanaent)
- after this select start --> it will boot and show a screen ---> seelct install red interprise 9.2 ----> select language --> system (installation destination)--> select that and select local standard disks ---> select software selection (tick on workstatin) it will give gui as same as windows ---> set root password ---> tick allow root ssh login with password ----> begin installation
