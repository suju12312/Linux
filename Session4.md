wired connection
wifi (wireless connection)
ip adress givve to network card


two laptop have connect via lan and having uique ip address after thast they connect with each other
ring === ping

www.google.com
time = 9ms (means packet goingf to google and requesting and after it reply and during this rtt check mround trip time )


IP ADDRESS (COMPUTER WE HAVE OIP ADDRESS AS SMAE AS MOBILE NO HAS NUMBER)   EG. 9372264203 (0-9)


IP ADDRRSSS 192.168.0.1 (RANGE FROM 0-255)
4 BYTES
 TASK : WHICH IS THE FOLLOWIGN IS VALID IP ADDREESS?
 192.168.0.1
 192.168.12345
 192.168567
 192.12121
 1
 ALL ARE HUNDED PERCEDNT VALID
IP ADDRESS ARE STORED IN NETRWORK PACKETS

IPV4 ----> 4BYTES OCCUPIED ---> VALID IP
THEY MAKE NEW RULE OF 4 DOT --- .  ----- . ----- . -----
BUT NOT HARCODED BUT DPOND ON US


TO KNOW HOW MANY NETWORK CARD WE HAVE ----> ifconfig

enp0s3 ---->  network card name
ifconfig enpos3 1.2.3.4
ifconfig enpos3 192.168.12345
bc (calculator)

4 bytes 1byte = 8bit
8*4 = 32 
2^32  4294967296 (range)


to reser netrworek --->wired connected --> turn off --> connect (gui rhel inside)


ping -c 2 google.com

ip ----> packet ----> 12345678 ----> send to network by internet

FIREWALL --> BLOCING ADDRESS 

IF TWO STYSTEM WE HAVE IF ONE SYSTEM A ARE THEY CONNEC OR NOT WE CHECK BY PING 

WINDOW CMD PROMPT  
TWO DIFFERENT OS 
IPCONFIG 192.168.1.12

PING 10.0.2.15

NO CONNECTIVITY (TIME OUT)
